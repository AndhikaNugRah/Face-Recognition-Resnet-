## Face Recognition for Gender Classification: Exploring ResNet-50 on the CelebA Dataset
This Google Colab notebook dives into the realm of face recognition, specifically focusing on gender classification using ResNet-50. The CelebA dataset, a massive collection of celebrity facial images, will serve as our training ground. We'll leverage ResNet-50, a powerful deep learning model, to extract features from faces and ultimately predict their genders.

# Why ResNet-50 and CelebA?
ResNet-50, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), has excelled in image classification tasks. Its residual connections combat the vanishing gradient problem, enabling deeper networks with enhanced performance. Here, we aim to harness these capabilities to extract meaningful features related to gender from facial images.
The CelebA dataset, boasting a vast collection of celebrity faces with associated gender labels, provides a rich training ground for our model. This abundance of data offers the potential to train a robust system capable of generalizing to unseen faces.

# Is ResNet-50 the Ultimate Choice?
While ResNet-50 is a strong contender, we shouldn't limit our exploration. This project might uncover alternative approaches. We might consider fine-tuning other pre-trained models from TensorFlow's keras.applications module, like VGG16 or InceptionV3, if computational resources permit.

# Project Goals:
Develop a face recognition system for gender classification using ResNet-50 and transfer learning.
Train and evaluate the model on the CelebA dataset.
Gain insights into the effectiveness of ResNet-50 for gender classification.
